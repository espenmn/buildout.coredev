PLIP 11774: Add "test mail server" form to Mail Settings
========================================================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11774

Review by Craig Haynal (cah190@psu.edu, cah190 on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.8 using python 2.6.6 and Safari 5.0.5.


Review steps
------------

- Ran plip11774-test-mail-server.cfg buildout.

- Ran tests for plone.app.controlpanel.

- Created and examined a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.

- Examined code.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- Form correctly handles missing field values.

- All cases of bad settings I tried were handled reasonably.

- Is sending a message actually necessary?  Many application frameworks
will just verify a connection can be established with a mail server.
The contact form is available to send a message.

- Is the test message appropriate and should it have localizations?
Right now the tone is a bit strange for a test message and it does not
appear to be localized.

- plone.app.controlpanel tests are passing.

- No tests cover the new button. 


Conclusion
----------

While it would be nice to have one or more tests cover the new "Save and send
test e-mail" button, I am satisfied that the implementation works and is
straightforward enough to merge.
