PLIP 11697: All authorinfo links opened in an overlay
=====================================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11697

Review #1 by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.7 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 4.0.1.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip11697-authorinfo-overlay.cfg file.

- Run tests for plone.app.layout.

- Visual review of the code in plone.app.layout.

- Run tests for Products.CMFPlone.

- Visual review of the code in Products.CMFPlone.

- Run the instance, add plonesite, add a user, test the overlays.


Notes and observations
----------------------
- The buildout for this PLIP uses Pil 1.1.7, but the normal buildout uses
  1.1.6, why was this changed?

> It was just a mistake

- All 96 plone.app.layout tests pass.

- Code in plone.app.layout looks sane, only a class 'userlink' is added.

- All 1112 Products.CMFPlone tests pass.

- Code in plone.app.testing looks sane, class 'userlink' is added and code
  to trigger overlay.

- When the testing the overlays they all worked.


Conclusion
----------

Looks very good, I'm +1 for merging.
