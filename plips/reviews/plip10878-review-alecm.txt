PLIP 10776: Include Zope 2.13
==============================================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10878

Review #3 by Alec Mitchell (alecm)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Chrome 7.0.517.41


Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the plip10878-siteadmin-role.cfg file

- Reviewed code changes in all affected packages, including
  GenericSetup config and migrations.
  
- Ran all tests

- Created new plone site, added site admin user. Tested various
  administrative actions as site admin user.

- Verified that site admin could not escalate privileges.


Notes and observations
----------------------
- Some of the permissions that should be assigned to the SiteAdmin
  role do not appear to be assigned in the ZMI.  This seems to be
  because add-ons regiser their permission/role mappings using
  CMFCore's setDefaultRoles and the zcml permission/role declarations,
  which only applies to the Zope root (where the role is not yet
  defined).  This is true for the permissions from Products.TinyMCE,
  Products.CMFEditions, plone.app.workflow, plone.portlet.collection
  and plone.portlet.static.  It seems that this is a purely cosmetic
  problem though, because the SiteAdmin can access the functionality
  restricted by these permissions, even if they don't appear to be
  assigned in the ZMI.
- The migration code looks appropriate, though like all significant
  migrations it will probably need some extensive real world testing. 
- I question the decision to exclude local workflow configuration
  policy from the SiteAdmin role.  It seems to me like a pretty
  typical - if advanced - SiteAdmin task.
- I saw something similar to the issue eleddy saw with role
  assignments not appearing.  Specifically, if I log in as a SiteAdmin
  and add a user, the group assignments made during user creation do
  not seem to apply.  Later group and role assignments work fine, as
  do group assignments performed as Manager during user add.
- The code to prevent privilege escalation works and appears well
  thought out.


Conclusion
----------
This implementation would be worth including for the increase in
permission granularity alone.  Everything seems to be solidly
implemented, aside from some relatively trivial issues.  I suspect
we'll need to make sure there's some very clear documentation to
assist people in e.g. updating custom workflows to support the new
role.  I strongly support including this PLIP in 4.1.
