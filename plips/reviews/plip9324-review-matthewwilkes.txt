===========================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9324

Reviewed by Matthew Wilkes

Review steps
------------

- Install and eyeball fallout
- Run through tours
- Run PyFlakes
- Run tests
- Run coverage
- Close reading of suspect modules from above
- Based on reading some more of the code, look for overuse of ZCA

Notes and observations
----------------------

Amberjack core
##############

  - jQueryUI is installed. That's a big beast of a package, and the only use
    for it I see is an optional enhancement. Do we really want this?

  - The amberjack popup is non-modal (obviously), movable (right), and styled
    the same as the other Plone jQueryTools popups. This seems a little
    confusing, to me.

  - The powered by amberjack and sunburst advert seems over the top.

  - The popup works well and is intuitive.

  - Clicking an amberjack link while the "All Done" popup is present brings up
    a jQueryUI error dialogue! Ew. The jQueryUI error comes up in a fair few
    places, actually.

  - The `tour_converter` module is very dense, unreadable code. I believe it
    is probably dead as it uses some dottednames that don't exist and has
    Python errors.

  - Amberjack skins are utilities just to provide names, this should be
    plone.app.registry.  In fact, you shouldn't need any Amberjack skins.

  - Imports of non-existant packages, i.e. zope.app.testing

  - Total 10 tests. viewlets.tour only has 27 test coverage and it's quite a
    big module.  That's not really enough.

  - The function javascriptSteps build javascript on the fly and returns it.
    It doesn't use a template or JSON, etc.

  - Bare except: `except Exception, inst: #XXX put the right Error`

  - You can upload a zip of tours, which are then saved as (ephemeral) global
    utilities. This means they bleed across instances, won't work with ZEO,
    and disappear on shutdown.

Amberjack portlet
#################

  - The edit portlet screen has an option to limit tours - is this actually
    useful?

  - i18n options are very good, including some existing translations.

  - There are 7 TODO entries in the tests for the portlets, and all but 1 test
    is commented out.

Amberjack Plone Tour
####################

  - The tour demonstrates some basic features of Plone well.

  - It is very much for developers, not end users. Users are instructed to do
    things like create a `MyFolder' folder. For me, this is the biggest issue,
    tours should be driven by user stories and requirements, not by checking
    off features.


Conclusion
----------

The Amberjack portlet is almost at a usable state, it works well for the
end-user, but it exposes too much of Amberjack the framework. The architecture
used to store and fetch tours is over the top and shows a misunderstanding of
various ZCA concepts. The inclusion of a new, large JS library isn't
acceptable.  The included tours are not suitable for end users.

I am going to have to recommend against inclusion of this PLIP at least until
the architecture is simplified and the tour rewritten.
