PLIP 9473: Include z3c.form
===========================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9473

Review by Martijn Pieters (mj@zopatista.com, mj@jarn.com, MJ on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.8 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.10.


Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the plip9472-9473-registry-z3cform.cfg file.

- Ran tests for plone.z3cform, plone.app.z3cform, plone.autoform

- Inspected code for same.

- Ran bin/alltests.

- Created and examined a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.

Notes and observations
----------------------

- The PLIP buildout also includes the implementation for PLIP 9472.

- I have been a user of these packages for some time and quite happy with the
  framework.

- plone.z3cform is in the svn.zope.org repository and is licensed under the 
  ZPL. A cursory review of the codebase showed no GPL violations. However,
  using the plone namespace implies that the codebase is under the governance
  of the Plone Foundation, which this clearly is not. A move to a BSD license
  and the Plone repository *or* a rename of the package to not use the plone
  namespace appears to be in order here.

- There is a hard dependency on KSS in plone.app.z3cform; can this be
  removed and the KSS code made conditional on KSS being present?

- Code for plone.z3cform, plone.app.z3cform, plone.autoform looks fine to me.

Conclusion
----------

This PLIP looks good, but the larger community may want to weigh in on the
licensing / location issue. I am +1 otherwise.
