PLIP 9938: factor custom output transformations out of the editors 
==================================================================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9938

Review by Craig Haynal (cah190@psu.edu, cah190 on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.5 using python 2.6.6 and Camino
2.0.6.


Review steps
------------

- Ran the plip9938-output-filters.cfg buildout.

- Ran tests for plone.outputfilters, plone.app.upgrade, plone.app.uuid,
plone.uuid, Plone, Products.Archetypes, Products.ATContentTypes,
Products.kupu, and Products.TinyMCE.

- Created and examined a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.

- Examined code.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- Tests for plone.outputfilters, plone.app.uuid, plone.uuid,
Products.Archetypes, Products.ATContentTypes, and Products.TinyMCE pass.

- Tests for plone.app.upgrade result in 3 errors, though they appear to
be unrelated to the PLIP.

- Tests for Plone result in 1 failure and 2 errors, none of which appear
directly related to the PLIP.

- Tests for Products.kupu result in 1 failure in testFilters
(Products.kupu.plone.tests.test_outputfilters.
OutputFiltersIntegrationTestCase).  It looks like the filter isn't
setting the caption for the first image correctly based on my quick
inspection of the test, so the Kupu integration with the output filter
may not be working correctly, at least in this test.

- Image captioning and uid-linking transforms work for TinyMCE.

- Image captioning and uid-linking transforms also work for Kupu.

- Kupu's popup windows were suffering from some glitchiness in the form
of doubled, overlapped icons and text in places while I was evaluating. 
I doubt these issues are directly related to this PLIP.  

- It seems a bit awkward to have the link-by-UID and imaging captioning
settings duplicated for each editor, but that is probably outside the
scope of this PLIP.

- The code and tests look good.


Conclusion
----------

I'm not sure why the integration test was failing in Products.kupu, but
so long as the test is fixed I am +1 to merge.
