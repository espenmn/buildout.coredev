PLIP 11773: Dexterity
=======================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11773

Review #1 by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.8 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 5.0.1.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip11773-dexterity.cfg file.

- Run tests p.a.dexterity and dependencies.

- Visual review of the code in all packages.

- Start instance, create a site, install Dexterity.

- Created 2 content types TTW, 1 container and 1 object item.

- Added fields to the content types.

- Added some example content using the above types.

- Export the type profile and schema models.

- Created filesystem based content types using models and python based
  schemata.

- Connected to the instance using webdav.


Notes and observations
----------------------
- All tests of all the packages pass. Overall coverage is very good (> 90%),
  with the exception of plone.formwidget.namedfile/widget.py (40%), NamedImage
  and Download class are not under test. Also some helper code in the utils
  files is not tested. I'm not sure all of this code is used, either create
  tests for them or remove the code.

- Code in the above mentioned packages looks sane.

- p.a.dexterity contains a couple of XXX statements which need to be fixed.

- The control panel is called "Dexterity Content Types". Since this is the only
  control panel for content types it should be either called just
  "Content Types" or "TTW Content Types".

- Adding content types and fields works really well.

- All the mostly used field types and widgets are available. For the ones
  which are not there addon products are also available.

- Rearranging fields using drag and drop uses a dotted red line for the
  "droppable area". I prefer if this has the same style as the drag and drop
  in the folder contents for consistency.

- "Filter content types" can not be set TTW. I think this will be used a lot
  and would be nice to have.

- Exporting the type profile and the schema works really nice, especially the
  round trip.

- Creating filesystem based content types is a lot easier then using Archetypes
  with a lot less boilerplate. The models approach using the xml files is nice
  because of the export ability in the TTW editor. Some settings are not
  possible with just the models xml so it seems the python based schemate are
  preferred. Converting the model xml to python based interfaces is not hard
  but can be a lot of work with big schemata.

- Connecting to the instances and browsing the dexterity types using webdav
  works fine.


Conclusion
----------

The product is well documented, well tested and works really well. One missing
feature to completely replace Archetypes is multilingual but that is out of
scope for this PLIP. p.a.dexterity also doesn't include standard types for
page, folder, newsitem etc. At this point this isn't needed but when Dexterity
will be replacing Archetypes completely they will need to be there. I'm +1
for merging.
