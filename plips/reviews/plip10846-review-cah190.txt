PLIP 10846: Include plone.testing and plone.app.testing in KGS
==============================================================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10846

Review by Craig Haynal (cah190@psu.edu, cah190 on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.10.


Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the plip9472-9473-registry-z3cform.cfg file.

- Ran tests for plone.testing and plone.app.testing.

- Inspected code in plone.testing and plone.app.testing.

- Ran bin/alltests.

- Created and examined a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- The PLIP buildout also includes the implementation for PLIP 9472 and 9473.

- The 6 tests in plone.testing have good coverage.

- There are 3 XXX markers in plone.testing which are relevant if 
  we move to Zope 2.13.

- The code in plone.testing looks reasonable.

- 2 of the 3 tests in plone.app.testing are failing as of 27-Sep-2010.
  The test coverage is acceptible for the code.

- There is one XXX marker in plone.app.testing that should be addressed,
  if necessary.

- Plone behaves normally.


Conclusion
----------

The failing tests and the XXX marker in plone.app.testing need to be
addressed.  The code looks solid, so I will be +1 for inclusion when
the tests are passing.
