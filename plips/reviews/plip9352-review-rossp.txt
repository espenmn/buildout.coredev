PLIP 9352: Improved search results
===========================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9352

Review by Ross Patterson (me@rpatterson.net, zenwryly on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty) using python 2.7.1
and Google Chrome 14.0.


Review steps
------------

- Ran the plips/plip9352-search-results.cfg buildout.

- Ran "bin/test -s plone.app.search --coverage=var/coverage"

- Ran "bin/test -s plone.testing -s plone.app.testing -s
  plone.app.search -s plone.app.contentlisting -s plone.app.upgrade -s
  plone.app.layout -s plone.app.portlets -s plonetheme.classic -s
  plonetheme.sunburst -s plone.app.testing -s plone.testing -s
  plone.app.controlpanel".

- Created a new Plone site.

- Performed a number of searches, modified filters, search terms,
  etc..

- Examined code.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- The installation profile for plone.app.search shows up on the Plone
  site add form.  Firstly, it needs a clear and descriptive title and
  description.  Secondly, should it be showing up there at all?
  Wouldn't this be part of the default Plone install?

  Update: This is still showing up on the Plone site add form but then
  doesn't show up on the add-on control panel.  Since it's installed
  by default, it shouldn't show up on the plone site add form.

- Test coverage on plone.app.search needs to be improved:

  lines   cov%   module   (path)
     84    45%   plone.app.search.browser   (/home/xen/src/plone-coredev.svn/src/plone.app.search/plone/app/search/browser.py)
    105    62%   plone.app.search.tests.base   (/home/xen/src/plone-coredev.svn/src/plone.app.search/plone/app/search/tests/base.py)
     64   100%   plone.app.search.tests.test_integration   (/home/xen/src/plone-coredev.svn/src/plone.app.search/plone/app/search/tests/test_integration.py)

- Select all/none seems to have a bug.

  1. Open advanced search form without any criteria by clicking on the
     site search button.  All site content is listed as it should be.

  2. Click "Filter the results", then under "Item type", click "Select
     All/None" and then "Page".  Note that only the "Welcome to Plone"
     default front page is listed as it should be.

  3. Click "Select All/None" and only "Welcome to Plone" is listed
     when all content should be listed again.  This is the bug.

  4. Click "Select All/None" again and all content is listed again as
     it should be.

- Browser history restores selected criteria but results don't reflect
  them.

  1. Open advanced search form without any criteria by clicking on the
     site search button.  All site content is listed as it should be.

  2. Click "Filter the results", then under "Item type", click "Select
     All/None" and then "Page".  Note that only the "Welcome to Plone"
     default front page is listed as it should be.

  3. Click on "Welcome to Plone" in the results and the browser
     navigates to that page as it should.

  4. Click "Back" in the browser.  Note that the type criteria
     selection is still "Page" but all content is listed.  This is the
     bug.

- RSS link does not reflect selected criteria.

  1. Open advanced search form without any criteria by clicking on the
     site search button.  All site content is listed as it should be.

  2. Click "Filter the results", then under "Item type", click "Select
     All/None" and then "Page".  Note that only the "Welcome to Plone"
     default front page is listed as it should be.

  3. Click on the RSS link and note that the RSS lists no items.  This
     is the bug.

- I think the "Filter the results" overlay could have a more
  attractive/clearer border.

- Just to record a future possibility, it might be nice to include
  some rudimentary configurability so that criteria can be disabled by
  site administrators.

- When I ran the tests for all auto-checkout packages, I got the
  following failures:

   testDoUpgrades (plone.app.upgrade.tests.test_upgrade.TestUpgrade)
   testListUpgradeSteps (plone.app.upgrade.tests.test_upgrade.TestUpgrade)
   plone-coredev.svn/src/plone.app.portlets/plone/app/portlets/tests/testViewName.txt
   testUpgrade (plone.app.upgrade.v25.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations)
   testBaseUpgrade (plone.app.upgrade.v30.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations)
   testFullUpgrade (plone.app.upgrade.v30.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations)
   testBaseUpgrade (plone.app.upgrade.v31.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations)
   testFullUpgrade (plone.app.upgrade.v31.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations)
   testBaseUpgrade (plone.app.upgrade.v32.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations)
   testFullUpgrade (plone.app.upgrade.v32.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations)
   testBaseUpgrade (plone.app.upgrade.v33.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations)
   testFolderUpgrade (plone.app.upgrade.v33.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations)
   testFullUpgrade (plone.app.upgrade.v33.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations)
   testFullUpgrade (plone.app.upgrade.v41.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations)
   plone-coredev.svn/src/plone.testing/src/plone/testing/z2.txt

  Not sure if they're relevant.

- I'm not sure that showing the relevance is as useless as the PLIP
  suggests.  Seeing that the most relevant result is just 10% relevant
  instead of 90% seems useful to me.  It's also very helpful
  information when sorting by something other than relevance.

- What is the current status of performance impact?  Has this been
  checked again since all the recent changes?

- The README.txt has an empty "Notes" section.  It needs to be updated
  or removed.

- Item 2. in plone.app.search/docs/TODO.txt should probably be
  addressed before included in a Plone core release.

Conclusion
----------

There are still too many bugs in this package:

  - profile appears on the add plone site form
  - select all/none
  - browser history
  - RSS link
  - current section search

If these can be fixed in the next week or two then I'm +1 for
merging.  But I am concerned that they might not get fixed given how
much time has already gone into this PLIP since we last reviewed and
encountered similar bugs.

Also, I would want to see the current status of the performance
impacts before approving for merging.  Can someone run these and
update the PLIP ticket?
