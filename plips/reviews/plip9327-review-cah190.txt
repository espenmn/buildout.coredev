PLIP 9327: unified interface for lists of content
=================================================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9327

Review by Craig Haynal (cah190@psu.edu, cah190 on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.8 using python 2.6.6 and Safari
5.0.5.


Review steps
------------

- Ran the plip9327-contentlisting.cfg buildout.

- Ran tests for Products.CMFPlone and plone.app.contentlisting.

- Created and examined a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.

- Examined code.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- Tests for plone.app.contentlisting all pass and have good coverage.

- Two unrelated migration tests fail in Products.CMFPlone.

- All previous concerns have been addressed, the code looks good and now
uses uuids where appropriate.

- The reimplementation of folder_listing.pt works, but may not be appropriate
for inclusion in this dot release of Plone, as it may break templates which
depend on the current implementation.


Conclusion
----------

The implementation of the content listing interface is ready for merge.
The updated folder_listing.pt should not be merged at this time; it may
be more suitable for a major Plone release.
