PLIP 11017: Tags MultiSelectionWidget w/scrollbar & checkboxes
==============================================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11017

Review #1 by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.5 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.13.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip11017-improve-tablesorter.cfg file.

- Run tests for Products.Archetypes

- Review the changes in Products.Archetypes

- Run tests for plonetheme.sunburst

- Review the changes in plonetheme.sunburst

- Start instance, create site, edit tags of a contenttype


Notes and observations
----------------------

- All tests in Products.Archetypes package pass.

- Markup changes in Products.Archetypes look sane.

- An external js library is included, it seems to work well but I have a few
  concerns:
  - it's 25kb unpacked which i quite a lot for "just" a keyword widget
  - The latest release of the package is in 2008, I don't see it being actively
    maintained
  - the package doesn't have any tests

- The widget doesn't have any tests which test the new functionality.

- All tests in plonetheme.sunburst package pass.

- The style for the widget is only added to the sunburst theme. Since we still
  support both themes this should also be added to the classic theme.

- Editing tags works well.

- The fallback for non-javascript also works very well.

- UI wise what I do think is strange is the fact you can remove currently
  selected tags with both the checkboxes and with the cross icon. If there is
  one way to remove them this would be more logical.


Conclusion
----------

Overall an improvement of the current widget but the js library and lack of
tests worry me, -1 for merging at this point.
