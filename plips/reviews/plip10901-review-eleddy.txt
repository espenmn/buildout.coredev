PLIP 10901: Set and enforce base coding standards for our own JavaScript
========================================================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10901

Review #2 by Elizabeth Leddy (eleddy)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.5 using python 2.6.6 and Chrome 7.0.517.44


Review steps
------------
- Review documentation
- Run tests for Plone.
- Run all the js files in ecmascript through jslint
- Validated test_ecmascripts.pt

Notes and observations
----------------------
 - The following do not validate with the given standards in hs-standards.js:
    - form_tabbing.js
    - formsubmithelpers.js
    - input-label.js doesn't validate to the js-standards.js and sets its own 
      validation items. 
    - jquery.highlightsearchterms.js - same issue as input-label.js.
    - livesearch.js - same issue as input-label.js.
    - table_sorter.js
    - testBeforeUnload.js
    - testNodeutilities.js
    - toc.js
    - unittestUtilities.js (not sure if this needs to validate)
    - unlockOnFormUnload.js - same issue as input-label.js
 - Several js files don't validate to the standards.js but set their own validation 
   schemes. It's worth considering setting nomen:false in the standard for now 
   with the anticipation of setting it to true at some point in the future.
 - 3 test cases are failing in test_ecmascripts.pt
    - PloneBeforeUnloadTestCase.testSelectOne, exception TypeError: Cannot call method 'indexOf' of undefined
    - PloneBeforeUnloadTestCase.testIdOverride, exception TypeError: Cannot call method 'indexOf' of undefined
    - PloneBeforeUnloadTestCase.testNoUnloadProtection, exception TypeError: Cannot call method 'indexOf' of undefined

Developer Manual Notes
----------------------
(http://plone.org/documentation/manual/developer-manual/client-side-functionality-javascript/referencemanual-all-pages)
 - The section on including javascript seems incomplete. Not sure what is
   happening there
 - In section 2, jQuery Tools, there is mention that masking should be
   avoided but no reference to why. I think the why part of this should be
   elaborated.
 - Since this is the developer manual, I'd like to see links to examples of
   using tabs, tooltips, overlays, and masking in plone (or at least to docs 
   explaining how they are integrated) 
 - In section 4 on the standards, I would like to see the tone be a little less
   wishy washy and a little more definitive. e.g. instead of "JavaScript should 
   nearly never be present" just saying "JavaScript should never". 
 - I really like the progressive enhancement section, however it is still unclear 
   how to handle #10794 for example. A section on whether or not plone 
   still cares about graceful degradation would be appreciated so that devs can 
   have a clear stance on bugs like that.
 - On my wish list is also a section on delegates and/or performance considerations. 
   The more we start to chow down on javascript the more important these will become.
 - The section on ajax and errors refers to reverse progressive enhancement to 
   handle errors, which I personally disagree with as the community recommendation. 
   There are many elegant ways to handle errors, and in this care I actually support
   trying to define recipes for handling common error situations. For example, 
   validation errors should always do X, 404's on form submits should be handled 
   with Y, etc. I'd be happy to discuss this in further detail.
 - It would be nice to see a section on developing javascript in third party products. 
   People are going to be unhappy if they install the latest and greatest product X 
   and then it makes basic functionality not work.

Conclusion
----------
This PLIP is long overdo and I expect it to be a work in progress for a while here. 


While I don't consider this ticket finished, I think the current changes can be merged 
as soon as the 3 failing js test cases are addressed.
