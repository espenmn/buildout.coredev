PLIP 9352: Improved search results
==================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9352

Review by Yiorgis Gozadinos (ggozad@jarn.com, ggozad on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.7 using python 2.6.5 and Safari.

First review: 30 Jun 2011

Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the plip9352-search-results.cfg file.

- Ran tests for plone.app.search, plone.app.contentlisting.

- Ran bin/alltests to check for additional failures in the Plone stack
  caused by PLIP changes.

- Reviewed the code in plone.app.search.

Notes and observations
----------------------

- All tests pass fine. I ran the performance tests several times and got
  favorable results consistently. Also tried to change the order of execution
  running first the new search, then the old search and vice versa to make
  sure preheating has no real effect but no noticeable difference was found.
  A small remark: The old search time is multiplied by 1.1 when compared to
  the new, presumably to allow for 10% slower results. This is not necessary
  and made me suspicious at first. Should be removed.
  Coverage is not great and could greatly improve if you try different
  scenarios in tests. It would be nice to see tests for the rss feeds
  particularly taking into account the points below.

- I have had trouble with the RSS feed:

    * Add a few items, mixing private and published content. Perform a search
      with no SearchableText and no additional filters. There are no results.
      Consecutively clicking on the RSS feed shows all items on the site. So
      it's inconsistent with the search results but also returns private content.
    * Nicely enough, if you DO filter by date (say display results since
      yesterday) only published items are shown.

- I've somehow managed to produce some errors on @@updated_search.
  It's hard for me to debug it/reproduce it properly, but here's the
  traceback: http://pastebin.com/BbTnHdU1. If it helps, I was using search
  strings that should give me no results, removing them, and trying again.

- While on the search results page, updating the searchable text and clicking
  on search again, includes all the filter parameters. So instead of

  ``@@search?SearchableText=stuff``

  you get
  
  ``@@search?advanced_search=False&sort_on=&SearchableText=stuff&pt_toggle=%23&portal_type%3Alist=Document&portal_type%3Alist=Folder&portal_type%3Alist=News+Item&portal_type%3Alist=Topic&created.query%3Arecord%3Alist%3Adate=1970-01-02&created.range%3Arecord=min``

  This is undesirable and it would be nice if it was fixed even this is the
  current behavior with the old search too.

- Searching with searchable text empty, show on the screen
  "No results were found", under "0 items matching your search terms".
  Searching with searchable text that will not produce any results does not
  display "No results were found".

- The "only in current section" setting is not preserved.

- When filtering results, in the "Item type" selection, only the content types
  which have been used already show up. This is nice and avoids the clutter
  but there might be some cases where listing all friendly types would be
  preferable.

- I am not as keen as the other reviewers on the relevance being shown. While
  it is nice to reassure the user that we have a "scientific" way to determine
  a search result 87% relevant, the way BM25 is used gives more or less random
  results imho ;)

Conclusion
----------

I enjoyed the ease offered by plone.app.search and really want it in core. It
replaces the close to unusable advanced search with something that feels modern
and clean. I would think most of the points mentioned here and by the other
reviewers could be addressed asap and then this will be ready for inclusion.
