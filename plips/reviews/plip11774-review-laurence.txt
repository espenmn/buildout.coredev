The PLIP was reviewed on MacOSX.


Review steps
------------

In the Mail Settings control panel:

* Set required email address, name and non-existent smtp server and clicked
  "Send test email".

* Observed the status messages::

    Error: Unable to send test e-mail, check your mail settings!
    Info: Changes saved.

* Started a local python debugging smtpd::

    $ python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer

* Changed the smtp server and port to localhost 8025 and clicked "Send test
  email".

* Observed the status messages::

    Info: Success! Check your mailbox for the test message.

    Hi,

    This is a test message sent from the Plone 'Mail settings' control panel. Y=
    our receipt of this message (at the address specified in the Site 'From' ad=
    dress field) indicates that your e-mail server is working!

    Have a nice day.

    Love,

    Plone

Notes and observations
----------------------

* I changed several aspects of the implementation to simplify the code.

* Unsure on placement and title of "Send test email" button. Should it go
  between "Save" and "Cancel"?

* Unsure about the tone of the status messages and email.

Conclusion
----------

Good to merge. May want to make a few tweaks afterwards.
