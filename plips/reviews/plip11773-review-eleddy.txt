Review #1 by Elizabeth Leddy (eleddy)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.5 using python 2.6.6, Chrome 7.0.517.44, 
iCal for mac

Review steps
------------
- Test all sorts of things in browser - INCOMPLETE

TODO:
- Run all tests
- Documentation Review

UI Notes and observations
-------------------------

Must Fix
--------
- I'm sure this is obvious but just in case, needs to be installed by default
- When I add a new content type with a description, the description doesn't show up 
  in the content type view
- There is no obvious way to edit these types. It may not be possible, but at minimum 
  shouldn't I be able to update the description? Bonus for type name. 
  There is no edit tab like default content types in plone which was kinda missing in 
  my end user perspective. Well, their is but it is the fields tab, which is weird. I 
  think this paradigm should be tightened up. For example, add an edit tab where the 
  description can be updated, then change the fields tab to have a title of "Fields"
- Adding a Rich text field, when I click settings, the rich text boxes don't load. Then, 
  if I click edit without visual editor, it redirects completely to another page with 
  no styling
- The default mime type descriptions are head exploding. They need descriptions and some 
  implications should be addressed. I'm not even sure why a description has a mime type 
  unless its just for filtering out html? Also, setting to None with text doesn't make 
  sense at all. I think a better paradigm is "leave blank". That goes double for 
  rich text (default value field).
- I find it really weird that Rich text preview allows me to actually edit the field and 
  disable the editor. I have no doubt that users will not understand that editing this 
  field does nothing. I would disable this, or even just turn it into an image that has 
  a preview stamp or something.The rest of the widgets seem to do this well.
- In addition, the rich text widget is so large that it is hard to move fields around.
- The difference between text and text line is no obvious until you add them. I've seen 
  these differentiated by "text line" and "paragraph text" or something like that. I 
  wish we could actually have a description next to each on of these controls, maybe a 
  la radio.
- In general, typing None in any text field is weird. Should just say "leave empty". I 
  would literally interpret the current instructions as type "None"
- Editing on a field has javascript confirmation to leave the page. Hm.
- Max length validation is wrong. It just cuts things off. As an end user, I type something 
  and then on save its gone. There is no counter or warning or anything. In most cases
  I assume the end user won't be the person who created the type and won't have this 
  inside knowledge.
- Preview of a type must include automatically generated stuff like title and description.
  These are pretty common first things to create. Also, people need to know that these things
  can be turned on and off.
- I added a field called description. Then, when I edit that type, the plone generated
  description now says : RichTextValue object. (Did you mean <attribute>.raw or <attribute>.output?)
  There should be checks on these short names to avoid metadata conflicts like this. Furthermore, 
  when I actually edit the description field (the dexterity one) no info is changed.
- When I edit a type, all of my objects of that type became unindexed.
- There is no validation on short names of fields. I added a space and completely borked a field.
- Read only doesn't make sense for some fields. How would a multiple choice widget be read only?
- DateTime doesn't let you select date only.
- Datetime widget doesn't have a calendar. I put this in must fix because if there was a widget 
  standard on the web it would say that all dates have a calendar
- "Boolean" widget view does not indicated unchecked. This particular control is mega weird to me.
  I find my self wanting a "radio" or a "checkbox" or "multiple checkboxes". Maybe I just don't get it
- Behaviors has several bugs. Selecting all exclude from navigation, and or next previous navigation 
  causes stack dump. Choosing basic metadata and dublin core doubles the title and description. These 
  are all when everything else is selected.
  
I'm going to stop here until some of this stuff is discussed. I don't know if this is the 
intent of the plip and want to make sure I'm not looking at the UI as an end all.
  
  
Maybe related but likely not:
- I couldn't run the upgrade step on any of my sites. I don't know if this is 
  related to this product or not. trace:

Nice to Fix
-----------
- Short name for adding a type does no validation. I added stuff with spaces. Maybe this is ok these 
  days but in my past experience this caused major upgrade headaches in the catalog.
  I like hoe the fields automatically make a suggested short name, and I think this 
  would be nice in add type form
- At some point PIL wasn't required for startup/testing. Looks like this 
  reintroduces that dependency, which is a bummer.
- Small typo  in the first control panel "Dexterity Content Types control panels lets you "
- Actually, that text isn't very descriptive at all. Would be nice to be more action 
  oriented like - "The following custom content types are available for your site" or 
  something. 
- There are some small CSS issues in Chrome when looking at the fields interface.
- Description for min and max length of a text field are for computers. Especially this: 
  If `min_length` is ``None``, there is no minimum, but then the default value is 0. Huh?
  Same comment on None and text fields as above.
- How about instead of calling it a Boolean we call it a Checkbox? This makes more sense as an
  end user. Also, what if I want a radio? like, "Am I happy with this process? " o yes o no
- "Vocabulary or source providing values" is a bad description. Is this comma seperated? line 
  separated? Can I point to some code somewhere? I suggest actually looking at google forms for 
  better way to do this. And are we still using that multi choice in and out thing? Why? Can't this 
  just be checkboxes? This widget makes me so sad.

Conclusion
----------
I haven't reviewed half of this but this is not ready for end users. 

Current vote is -1 for 4.2.  Based on initial review, I think this should be worked on a
bit with a new target of 4.3 release. I know the devs on this are really awesome and responsive 
so I would like to get their feedback, find out whats doable, and go from there.
