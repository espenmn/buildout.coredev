PLIP 11300: Switch to HTML 5 
============================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11300

Review #1 by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.7 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 4.0.1.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip11300-switch-to-html5.cfg file.

- Run tests for Products.CMFPlone.

- Visual review of the code in Products.CMFPlone.

- Run tests for plone.app.layout.

- Visual review of the code in plone.app.layout.

- Run tests for plonetheme.sunburst.

- Visual review of the code in plonetheme.sunburst.

- Validated the html using the w3c validator.


Notes and observations
----------------------
- The buildout for this PLIP uses Products.GenericSetup 1.6.1, but the normal
  buildout uses 1.6.3, why was this changed?

- All but 1 of the 1112 Products.CMFPlone tests pass. Failing test is because
  of the upgraded profile number, this needs to be fixed in the upgrade test.

- Code in Products.CMFPlone looks sane, doctype has been changed to the
  correct value. Modernizr has been added. Conditional html tags are added
  to identify the different versions of IE. The conditional html tag at
  the end uses "if gt IE 8" better would be "if (gt IE 8)|!(IE)". The link
  to the explaination of the method is nice for the review but should be
  removed when the code is merged.

- All 96 plone.app.layout tests pass.

- Code in plone.app.layout looks sane, replaced acronym with abbr. Removed
  head navigation tags. Fixed validation of personal tools.

- All 3 plonetheme.sunburst tests pass.

- Code in plone.sunburst looks sane, changes are the same as above and merged
  iefixes in the default css files using the new ie specific classes on the
  html element.

- Validation passed with the exception of the "kinetic-stylesheet" custom
  rel attribute.


Conclusion
----------

The code changes look good. What I don't understand is why modernizr is used.
The comments in the css suggest that modernizr adds the ie6, ie7 etc classes
to the html document but that is not the case, they are added using
conditional html comments. The PLIP states modernizr is used to strip out
HTML5 specific tags but as far as I can see none are used right now. Please
explain why we need modernizr at this time.
