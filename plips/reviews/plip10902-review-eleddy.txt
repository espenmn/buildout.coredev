===========================
PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10902

Review by Elizabeth Leddy (elizabeth.leddy@gmail.com, eleddy on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OSX using python 2.6.5 and Google Chrome

Review steps
------------
- Created a new Plone site with the plone.app.collection add-on
  included.
- Worked the UI in the portal
- Reviewed code.
- run js through jslint

Notes and observations
----------------------
- adding a new collection, what is allowed users and roles supposed to 
  filter on? it doesn't seem to filter on anything
- It's not entirely clear how to close the drop down for review state. I 
  think that I expected to click outside of the drop down and have it 
  disappear (onblur).
- Once I add a criteria, then try to add another one that is the same, the 
  results end up being a little weird. For example, I have description and 
  the word "tomato" with three results. then add another description field 
  with no words at all and I get 21 results. I would expect these to be 
  an intersection, although I could be wrong since there is no indication.
  I think its just a bug though.
- When using location, if I select relative path and put in a full path, I 
  get lots of errors in the logs:

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'getPhysicalPath'
- For me the path wording is a little confusing. I think simply renaming 
  Path(URL) to absolute path would help, since its the "opposite" of relative
  path
- It would be nice if the query did not submit and filter 
  until after the user enters something in the box. I often found myself adding 
  a filter and then wanting to see what I had in the live search but it was gone.
  This also makes sense in cases where the filter does not apply to the objects being
  displayed (e.g. event start and end date)
- Adding a modification date after date "201" triggered an error (was trying to get 
  to "2010"). This happened with a lot of dates:

- Also nice to have is not to delete the contents of a box if I switch to 
  another criteria and then decide to come back. This makes sense if I'm 
  trying to decide between using title, description, or searchable text for
  example
- I'm slightly concerned by the number of requests it takes to return these 
  results. 
- More nice to have is that for items where you have no other choices for the 
  type of query (e.g Description "is" versus Locations rel/abs choice) I would 
  like to see that be text instead of a drop down. This control makes me wonder 
  as the end user if I should check for more options each time and the majority
  of the time I don't need to.
- I don't think that sorting on title in reverse is a good default. most people
  would expect it to not be reversed. If modification date were selected I would 
  agree but I think sortable title is the correct choice here
- What happened to display as table checkbox? If its gone then we need to remove 
  the table columns listing. I think this is referring to the display view but 
  kinda makes no sense.
- How about this "table of contents" checkbox? From what I can tell it doesn't 
  do anything. I'm not too familiar with collections so I could be way off.
- when adding the related to field I immediately get an error: 
2010-12-17 18:19:42 ERROR Zope.SiteErrorLog 1292638782.460.265875466564 http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@querybuildernumberofresults

- The same issues with * and some unicode as with the p.a.search plip. Must be able to 
  handle ParseError: Query contains only common words: '* . In addition, need a way to 
  pipe feedback to the user.
- When working with adding the collections portlet, instead of saying "search results" it 
  would be nice to say "available collections". In general, this portlet ui has me 
  wondering what I should actually be doing. what does the "parent" button mean?
- Plone.app.collection: Need to have README say something
- Plone.app.collection: TODO in collection.py
- It looks like that in order to add a collection you have to be a manager which I 
  think is unnecessarily limiting. At minimum let's integrate it with Site Administrator 
  or even Editor. I think add collection portlet sounds like something for the site 
  administrator role as well.
- seems to be an extra leading semicolon in querywidget.js. There are lots of errors with 
  that js that make me cross browser nervous. Addressing these would make me feel happy
- The query field widget could use some better documentation.

Conclusion
----------
This UI is really slick. This makes me actually want to use collections. A few things 
that must get fixed before merge:
 - must address all the bad user input issues
 - work on the stack traces in all the reviews
 - fix obvious js errors
Those seem all doable and I'm sure this will make a nice addition to the 4.1 release.
