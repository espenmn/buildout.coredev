PLIP 9288: Improved Commenting Infrastructure
========================================================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9288

Review #1 by Elizabeth Leddy (eleddy)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.5 using python 2.6.6 and Chrome 7.0.517.44

Review steps
------------
- Run all discussion tests
- Review code with eyeballs
- Test in browser

Notes and observations
----------------------
 - In catalog.py, there is a TODO on the effective date. Are comments going to have an
   effective date or... why would this be implemented?
 - In the control panel, this is listed as an add on configuration but should go under 
   a core plone configuration
 - When editing in the control panel view, submission redirects to site setup page instead 
   of back to the same form. This is at worst annoying but the standard for editing these 
   forms is to redisplay the form itself.
 - In the configuration panel, the "Comment text transform" field needs a description. What 
   is intelligent text? When I select that how come the comment form still says plain text
   formatting?
 - In the configuration panel, email notification fields should be disabled if a mail host 
   has not been configured. Also, who is the moderator? How is this email address set?
 - Note that this needs to be installed currently. I'd like to see a configuration where 
   this is already done by default before the other reviews
 - There is something funky with the perms. I have no idea whats up.
   I can't add a comment with "Authenticated" permissions. When not logged in, 
   the content type says "login to add comments". So I log in and then I still can't add comments. 
   When I click allow anonymous comments, I can add comments but I can't add them when I am 
   authenticated as a basic user with "Authenticated" permissions. 
 - Moderating comments by changing the workflow is gross. I think it's work the extra effort 
   here to add a moderate comments checkbox to the add on configuration.
 - In the discussion settings, globally enabling comments is insanely confusing. I don't 
   even understand what it does. I think that this should either do what it says - "Globally 
   enable comments" - or remove it.
 - Removing a comment at the top level of a thread removes all comments underneath. This 
   isn't ok and I think will lead to some frustration. I'm not sure how this reworks the 
   commenting threads and display et al. I have seen in practice that deleting a potentially
   offensive comment just replaces the content of the comment with a message that says "This
   comment has been deleted by the moderator." This keeps the flow of conversation going and 
   doesn't make people mad when their potentially relevant comment is deleted.
 - The delete button to the far right of the comment is insanely confusing. I think this 
   could use some UI review
   
NOTE: I stopped reviewing at this point. There is a lot to be done and I'm happy to come 
back at a later point once things have been addressed.

Conclusion
----------
For a proper review, I'd like to see it completely integrated as the end user would experience 
the product. I have used the base of this code for other products and I know that it has good 
meaty parts but the user experience is more confusing than the current implementation. There is 
a lot of added features that will be insanely useful so I'm glad the work has been done.

Additionaly I'm concerned about the integration with the site admin role. I'd like to 
see that role and these permissions integrated and worked out before merging.

I do not recommend merging the current implementation. If it means waiting until 4.2 I think it's
worth it to work out the kinks. It will be an awesome feature when its ready.
