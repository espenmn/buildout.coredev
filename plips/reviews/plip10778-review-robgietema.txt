PLIP 10778: Standalone UUID implementation
==========================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10778

Review #1 by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.10.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip9938-output-filters.cfg file.

- Run tests for plone.uuid.

- Visual review of the code in plone.uuid.

- Run tests for plone.app.uuid.

- Visual review of the code in plone.app.uuid.

- Started instance, created site.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- All 5 plone.uuid tests pass. Test coverage is close to 100%.

- Code in plone.uuid looks sane.

- Although not a requirement it is best practice to use PEP8 and the ZCML style
  guide (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/,
  http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/ZCMLStyleGuide)

- All 7 plone.app.uuid tests pass. Test coverage is above 90%.

- The plone.app.uuid i18n domain is used, this should be just plone.

- Code in plone.app.uuid looks sane.

- If I understand the comments on the plip correctly no new catalog index
  should have been created. I do see a catalog.xml file in plone.app.uuid, is
  this needed?

- The test code is in testing.py and tests.py, I prefer this being in a tests
  folder to not mess up the package root.


Conclusion
----------

Looking very good, some minor fixes and I'm +1 for merging.
