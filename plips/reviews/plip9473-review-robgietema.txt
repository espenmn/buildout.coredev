===========================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9473

Review #1 by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.10.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip9472-9473-registry-z3cform.cfg file.

- Run tests for plone.z3cform.

- Visual review of the code in plone.z3cform.

- Run tests for plone.app.z3cform.

- Visual review of the code in plone.app.z3cform.

- Run tests for plone.autoform.

- Visual review of the code in plone.autoform.

- Started instance, created site.

- Install plone.app.discussion to get some browser views using z3c.forms.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- All 72 plone.z3cform tests pass. Test coverage is above 90%.

- Code in plone.z3cform looks sane.

- plone.z3cform i18n domain is used and the package also contains a locales
  folder. I think this should go into the plone domain.

- Still 3 'XXX' in the code, not sure if this can be refactored.

- Templates in crud use classes with a dash, like 'batch-navigation', this
  should be 'batchNavigation'.

- Although not a requirement it is best practice to use PEP8 and the ZCML style
  guide (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/,
  http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/ZCMLStyleGuide)

- The package contains a buildout.cfg file, this should not be here.

- The code for this package itself is in the Zope svn repo. Why is it not in
  the Plone svn repo?

- All 17 plone.app.z3cform tests pass. Test coverage is close to 100%.

- Code in plone.app.z3cform looks sane.

- The package contains a buildout.cfg file and a versions-plone33.cfg, this
  should not be here.

- z3c.formwidget.query and collective.z3cform.datetimewidget are included as
  dependency.

- z3c.formwidget.query uses it's own i18n domain and the packages doesn't
  contain a locales folder.

- plone.app.z3cform is depending on kss, this hard dependency doesn't work well
  with the "make kss optional"-plip so needs some attention.

- templates/macros.pt uses some tabs, should be spaces.

- Markup of the default forms and widgets looks fine.

- All 53 plone.autoform tests pass. Test coverage is close to 100%.

- The plone.autoform i18n domain is used in configure.zcml, this should be
  changed to plone.

- Code in plone.autoform looks sane.


Conclusion
----------

Looking very good so far. Some final adjustments and then I'm +1 for merging.
