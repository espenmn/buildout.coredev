PLIP 10809: Table sort internationalization
===========================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10809

Review #1 by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.5 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.13.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip10809-improve-tablesorter.cfg file.

- Run tests for Plone.

- Run the js files through jslint

- Review the changes in table_sorter.js

- Start instance, create site, test the table sorter


Notes and observations
----------------------

- 2 tests fail in the Plone package but these don't seem related to the changes
  made for this plip.

- The table_sorter.js file doesn't pass the jslint tests. Officially this is
  not part of the plip but it would be nice to fix this before merging with
  plip 10901.

- The changes in table_sorter.js all look sane. I know the current
  implementation doesn't have unittests but I would really like to see js
  unittests for new features which are added to Plone.

- I've tested the table sorting in several scenario's and it was working like
  it should.


Conclusion
----------

Looking very good, if some unittests are added and the jslintification is
discussed with the author of plip 10901 I'm +1 for merging.
