PLIP 11697: Author info overlay
===============================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11697

Review by Yiorgis Gozadinos (ggozad@jarn.com, ggozad on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.7 using python 2.6.5 and Safari,
Firefox.


Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the plip11697-authorinfo-overlay.cfg file.

- Ran tests for plone.app.layout, CMFPlone

- Reviewed the code changes in plone.app.layout, Products.CMFPLone.

Notes and observations
----------------------

- Code changes are minor, essentially only css classes and js hooks to use the
  overlay are added. As a result, the absence of tests is not important.

- I would expect a bit of rethinking moving to an overlay: In short, I would
  welcome an overlay with less information than potentially the author info,
  contact form and the list of the content that the author has created. In my
  mind this is too much to put in the overlay. Preferably, the contact form
  and/or the list of content would be separate.

- Disregarding the above presents some challenges:

  - When you use the contact form inside the overlay, after successfully
    sending a message you end up at the contact form where the status message
    that the mail was sent is shown. This defies using the overlay in the
    first place as now you have lost your context.

  - Related to the above is that the use of the overlay in combination with 
    the contact form creates the expectation that the user contacts the author
    about the content. No information or context is given in the contact mail
    though.

- A problem I encountered was by visiting the author info as the author user.
  In that particular case, the contact form is not shown and the overlay 
  breaks.

- Since this PLIP has to do with UI consulting with the UI team on its
  implementation seems essential. From what I gather
  (http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.zope.plone.ui/1277/)
  the opinions given are rather on the negative side and raise an issue about
  the need altogether to move the author info to an overlay.

Conclusion
----------

I would be a -1 on this PLIP as is. If it gets reworked to address the
issues caused and offer an alternative that adds value I would heartily
vote for its inclusion, but in its current state I think sticking with what we
already have is better.
