PLIP 10878: Add "SiteAdmin" role
================================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10878

Review by Craig Haynal (cah190@psu.edu, cah190 on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.10.


Review steps
------------

- Ran the plip10878-siteadmin-role.cfg buildout.

- Ran bin/alltests.

- Created and examined a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.

- Created a user with the SiteAdmin role and tested administrative activities.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- This PLIP uses Zope 2.13 as per PLIP 10776.

- Running alltests yields many failures above and beyond those from the 
  Zope 2.13 PLIP.  There seem to be a number of errors regarding the
  Access Transient Object permission:

  "ValueError: The permission <em>Access Transient Objects</em> is invalid."

  Currently there are 23 failures testing this PLIP versus 3 failures
  testing the Zope 2.13 PLIP.

- Despite the test failures, Zope starts up and behaves normally.

- The configlets available to the SiteAdmin user largely behaved as expected.

- When trying to add a new user as a SiteAdmin, the group assignment-at-
  creation functionality does not appear to work.  Checking boxes to assign
  other users the SiteAdmin group or the Reviewers group had no effect on
  user creation, i.e. the users were created without the selected groups.
  The groups could still be assigned by editing the user or the group.
  Manager-level users could create users and assign groups in the user
  creation dialog, as expected.

- Managing portlets as a SiteAdmin worked as expected.

- Could not use the ZMI as SiteAdmin, as expected.

- The SiteAdmin could not manage viewlets or use the ownership_form.
  Managing viewlets is somewhat dangerous so that seems to be a sensible
  restriction, but is there any reason we shouldn't allow SiteAdmins to
  use the ownership_form?
 
- Code changes seem sensible, though there is currently a breakpoint
  in a test of the checked-in branch of plone.app.upgrades:

  https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.upgrade/branches/plip10878-siteadmin-role/plone/app/upgrade/v41/tests.py

- Permissions at the Plone Site level look reasonable.


Conclusion
----------

I am satisfied with the functionality and implementation of this PLIP.
The failing tests will need to be addressed and the issues with the
Zope 2.13 PLIP will need to be resolved before this is ready for merge.
