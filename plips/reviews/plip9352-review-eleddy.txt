PLIP 9352: Improved search results
==================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9352

Review by Elizabeth Leddy (eleddy on irc or elizabeth.leddy@gmail.com)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.5 and Chrome


Review steps
------------
- Ran buildout using the plip9352-search-results.cfg file.
- Ran performance benchmarks using bin/test -s plone.app.search --tests-pattern=performance
- Reviewed the code in plone.app.search
- Tested searching in new plone site. 
- Ran JS through JS lint.

Notes and observations
----------------------
- Performance test for new search was better as well. yay!
- Weird bug. Added a file with the keyword "image". Then I clicked search and the correct 
  results were returned. Then I modified the search page to have the words "ima" which 
  correctly returned no results. Then I changed the words back to "image" expecting the 
  first result and got nothing. I seem to only be able to recreate this with file and
  image types. I think its because of the workflow states being passed back 
  not meshing with the image/file workflow states (image/file has none IIRCC).
- Searching with * through live search throws the classic "ParseError: Query contains only 
  common words: '*'" error. This error should be could and "no results found" error -or- 
  return all results. Anything but an error really. Same type of error on some unicode 
  characters (but not most). 
- Additionally, when searching by ajax on *, the number of results is not updated. I assume 
  this is because of the error state. I believe this is mentioned in the other review but 
  just make sure to note we need to address error states, especially in the javascript.
- Picky style thing - there is a double underline on the words "You can narrow them down." I 
  assume this wasn't intentional (testing on Chrome)
- "Located in" doesn't work for items in the base Plone folder. In general, this is weirdly 
  implemented to me. I have subfolders in subfolders and it doesn't list the full link - 
  only grabs the top level it seems. I personally don't think this is useful and preferred the 
  proposed implementation of just listing the link.
- sorting by date(newest first) actually sorted by oldest first.
- Icon consistency is weird. Folders had icons but other content didn't. I would go all or none.
- There is a page refresh when toggling the select all/none buttons, but the results are 
  the same. A simple JS check here would reduce hits on the server, especially important for 
  large result sets.
- It seems to me it would be useful if the RSS feed was accessible without going to the 
  advanced search sidebar. 
- Not sure if this plip did anything to RSS, but the description tag simply says "These are the 
  search results for the query, showing results 1 to 4." At minimum this should have the 
  words that were queried. The rss also seems to ignore the advanced query options (e.g. 
  filtering on content type).
- I agree with davids review that the back button (history) needs to be fixed. This can be 
  frustrating for beginning and advanced users. In addition to that, if I click on an item 
  and then click the back button to return to search results, the search results are no 
  longer filtered BUT showing the filter panel makes it look like they are. Implementing 
  history could fix this. At the very minimum, we need to reset those options.
- A loader would be nice for those of use that can't get out shit together and it takes a while 
  to return results :D This is a nice to have for large data sets.
- I don't like seeing DateTime in the templates. Would like to see that replaced with std 
  datetime module.
- Would also like to see those onclick events in the template converted to events in javascript 
  if its possible. 
- Super tiny, but in the js the variable names "str" and "struct" are hard for other people to 
  maintain.
- I agree with other viewers that relevance isn't as useless as it seems. At minimum, if you are 
  going to be able to sort by relevance it should show the sorting criteria.
- Searching within a certain section works nice, but then if you try to sort those results it 
  removes that criteria and searches the whole site. Same for advanced filter. I can understand 
  the advanced filter ignoring the path criteria (although it should state it somewhere, e.g 
  a check box showing that path) but sorting the results shouldn't ignore.
- In the search browser view there is an import statement in results under and if statement. Any 
  reason why this wouldn't be at the top? Note I don't use batch a lot so there may be a side 
  effect I don't know about.
  
Conclusion
----------
While there are a long list of things up there they are all small bugs and overall this is a great 
upgrade to search. I think most of these issues are small and the core can be merged but I'd like 
to see the obvious ones fixed for 4.1 (mainly error handling, sorting).
