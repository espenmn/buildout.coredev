PLIP 10778: Standalone UUID implementation
==========================================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10778

Review by Craig Haynal (cah190@psu.edu, cah190 on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.10.


Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the plip9938-output-filters.cfg file.

- Ran tests for plone.uuid and plone.app.uuid, and Products.Archetypes.

- Inspected code in plone.uuid, plone.app.uuid, and Products.Archetypes.

- Ran bin/alltests.

- Created and examined a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.

- Tested the @@uuid and @@redirect-to-uuid views.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- The PLIP buildout also includes the implementation for PLIP 9938.

- plone.uuid has an XXX marker in configure.zcml, though it will be
  relevant if we go with Zope 2.13 for Plone 4.1.

- The 5 tests in plone.uuid cover nearly all the code.

- Code for plone.uuid looks reasonable.

- The @uuid view works as expected.

- The 7 tests in plone.app.uuid cover nearly all the code.

- The @@redirect-to-uuid view in plone.app.uuid throws an exception if
  no UUID is provided, perhaps it should return something like a 400 Bad
  Request or a 404 Not Found instead of raising a KeyError?

- The @@redirect-to-uuid view causes a redirection loop to
  @@redirect-to-uuid/None if an invalid/missing UUID is provided.
  I would expect a 404 Not Found if the UUID cannot be resolved.

- Code for plone.app.uuid looks reasonable.

- Changes in the Products.Archetypes branch look reasonable and tests
  are passing.


Conclusion
----------

Other than the @@redirect-to-uuid issues, the implementation
is excellent.  I am +1 to merge if the error handling is improved
for that view.
