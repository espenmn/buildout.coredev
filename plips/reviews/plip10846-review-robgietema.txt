PLIP 10846: Include plone.testing and plone.app.testing in KGS
==============================================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10846

Review #1 by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.10.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip9472-9473-registry-z3cform.cfg file.

- Run tests for plone.testing.

- Visual review of the code in plone.testing.

- Run tests for plone.app.testing.

- Visual review of the code in plone.app.testing.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- All 6 plone.testing tests pass. Test coverage is above 90%.

- Code in plone.testing looks sane.

- Although not a requirement it is best practice to use PEP8 and the ZCML style
  guide (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/,
  http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/ZCMLStyleGuide)

- 2 out of 3 tests fail, this needs to be fixed.

- Code in plone.app.testing looks sane.

- plone.app.testing contains one XXX statement not sure if this is still valid.


Conclusion
----------

Looking very good, if the tests will be fixed I'm +1 for merging.
