PLIP 10809: Table sort internationalization
===========================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10809

Review #1 by Elizabeth Leddy (eleddy)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.5 using python 2.6.6 and Chrome 7.02.


Review steps
------------
 - Review code
 - run through jslint
 - Create fresh plone site, test sorting on different dates without the sortable name
   code
 - Test sorting with the sortable name and various values

Notes and observations
----------------------
 - not sure that this is related to this plip but when looking at a sortable table I 
   get a few viewport argument not recognized errors from this line in the html:
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width; initial-scale=0.6666; maximum-scale=1.0; minimum-scale=0.6666" />
 - JS doesn't pass through new jslint standard. It's not a requirement for merging 
   but definitely nice to have.
 - Added a table with a column of dates and sorting works on the first two clicks 
   but stops working afterwords. The test data set is: '2010-12-22', '2010-09-14', 
   '2010-06-11', '2010-01-09'. Again, first two sorts work then unresponsive.
 - Code looks sane
 - Author said there were issues with unittests but maybe integrating with 
   test_ecmascripts.pt is the best option here?

Conclusion
----------
This is a small plip and nothing seems to have been broken. I would have actually 
like to see this plip go further and make some sorting work by default (e.g. 
dates formatted with a '/'). I would like to see the code in the plip ticket 
integrated into test_ecmascripts.pt at minimum before merging but other than 
that, +1 to merge.
