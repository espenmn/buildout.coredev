PLIP 9472: Include plone.app.registry
=====================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9472

Review #1 by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.10.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip9472-9473-registry-z3cform.cfg file.

- Run tests for plone.supermodel.

- Visual review of the code in plone.supermodel.

- Run tests for plone.registry.

- Visual review of the code in plone.registry.

- Run tests for plone.app.registry.

- Visual review of the code in plone.app.registry.

- Started instance, created site.

- Install plone.app.discussion to get some values in the registry.

- Edit values in the control panel.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- All 66 plone.supermodel tests pass. Test coverage is at around 90%.

- Code in plone.supermodel looks sane.

- plone.supermodel i18n domain is used in configure.zcml, this should be plone.

- Still 3 'XXX' in the code, not sure if this can be refactored.

- Although not a requirement it is best practice to use PEP8 and the ZCML style
  guide (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/,
  http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/ZCMLStyleGuide)

- All 105 plone.registry tests pass. Test coverage is at around 90%.

- Code in plone.registry looks sane.

- plone.registry i18n domain is used in configure.zcml, this should be plone.

- One 'XXX' in the code, not sure if this can be refactored.

- All 39 plone.app.registry tests pass. Test coverage is close to 100% although
  the controlpanel and edit form don't seem to have any tests at all, this
  should be fixed.

- The plone.app.registry i18n domain is used in all files, this should be
  changed to plone.

- Editing of the values in the control panels works.

- A tool is being registered as 'portal_registry' which also contains the
  Plone Controlpanel view. Is this really needed? I prefer having a
  @@registry-controlpanel view and as few objects in the zmi as possible.


Conclusion
----------

Looking very good so far. Some final adjustments and then I'm +1 for merging.
