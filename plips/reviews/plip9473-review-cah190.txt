PLIP 9473: Include z3c.form
===========================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9473

Review by Craig Haynal (cah190@psu.edu, cah190 on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.10.


Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the plip9472-9473-registry-z3cform.cfg file.

- Ran tests for plone.z3cform, plone.app.z3cform, plone.autoform

- Inspected code in plone.z3cform, plone.app.z3cform, and plone.autoform.

- Ran bin/alltests.

- Created and examined a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- The PLIP buildout also includes the implementation for PLIP 9472.

- plone.z3cform is in the svn.zope.org repository; should it be
  moved to the plone repo?

- There are three XXX markers still in the code for plone.z3cform.
  The one in z2.py can be easily addressed since we are targeting
  Zope >= 2.11; the other two may require some refactoring.

- Code for plone.z3cform looks reasonable.

- The 72 tests in plone.z3cform cover the bulk of the code.

- plone.app.z3cform contains a buildout.cfg that should probably 
  not be present.

- plone.app.z3cform depends on collective.z3cform.datetimewidget,
  should we be depending on packages in the collective?
  
- Code for plone.app.z3cform looks reasonable.

- The 17 tests in plone.app.z3cform cover almost all of the code.

- Code for plone.autoform looks reasonable.

- The 53 tests in plone.autoform cover almost all of the code.


Conclusion
----------

This PLIP looks good.  With a few tweaks I'm +1 to merge.
