PLIP 11065: Ship with plone.app.caching
=======================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11065

Review #1 by Laurence Rowe (l@lrowe.co.uk, elro on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on FreeBSD, Ubuntu and MacOSX.


Review steps
------------

* Setup caching on plone.org and shuttlethread.com using plone.app.caching
  under Plone 4.0.

* Installed and uninstalled in a Plone 4.1 buildout.

Notes and observations
----------------------

* The monkey patches used in plone.caching 1.0b1 are gone.

* Installs and uninstalls cleanly.

Conclusion
----------

This is being used in production already and is safe to merge.
