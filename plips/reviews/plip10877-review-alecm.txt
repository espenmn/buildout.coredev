PLIP 10877: Separate Products.CMFPlone from the Plone egg and its optional dependencies
=======================================================================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10877

Review #1 by Alec Mitchell (alecpm@gmail.com, alecm on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.8 using python 2.6.5 and Google
Chrome 6.0.472.53.


Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the plip10877-separate-products-cmfplone.cfg file.

- Reviewed the code changes in the Plone package and the new
  Products.CMFPlone package

- Checked that svn history was preserved on the new branches.

- Ran bin/alltests

- Created and browsed a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.


Notes and observations
----------------------

* Changes are minimal beyond the svn structure changes.

* Test results are no different than the Plone 4.1 base tests.

* The new svn structure seems reasonable and the history has been
  preserved as expected.

* The PLIP buildout config has an explicit PIL egg dependency, which
  doesn't appear to exist in the standard buildout.  I find this
  curious.


Conclusion
----------

These changes are quite simple, and provide some very useful
benefits for deployments of Plone-based applications.  I recommend
merging this work as soon as possible to minimize additional merge
work for subsequent PLIPs which may require changes to the
Plone/Products.CMFPlone package.
