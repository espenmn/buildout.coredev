PLIP 10776: Include Zope 2.13
==============================================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10878

Review #2 by Elizabeth Leddy (eleddy)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Chrome 6.0.4


Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the plip10878-siteadmin-role.cfg file 
  
- Ran all tests

- Ran upgrade on an existing site

- Created a new site, added users for admin role and validated that every menu 
  in the control panel edited and saved without error. Did the same for each non-
  site admin user to confirm they couldn't access.

- Reviewed portal workflows - verified that each state that had a manager permission 
  also had a site admin permission

- Added users to admin group and verified groups work the same as direct role assignment

Notes and observations
----------------------
- Upgrade failed on both existing sites from configuration 4100 to 4015. No 
  obvious errors - not sure what happened. I am happy to help debug this. All I did 
  was create a site in the 4.1 branch, zope 2.12, add a site, then run the plip 
  buildout and restart. None of my sites successfully upgraded.
- WRT the upgrade I don't agree with automatically reindexing the allowedRolesAndUsers
  index. I am open to discuss this but this would kill large sites. I don't know how 
  other people manage this but I know I have custom lazy workflow upgrading hacks in 
  several large projects. Is there a way to make this optional or to make a decision 
  based on the number of objects for example? This is especially important for projects 
  that may not need or see the benefit of SiteAdmin and won't upgrade because of it. 
- SiteAdmin can edit portlets, but cannot manage viewlets. Is this by design? I don't 
  want to get into a bikeshed argument - just confirming.
- The control panel at 'plone_control_panel' lists two "Users and Groups", one pointing
  to @@usergroup-userprefs and the other to @@usergroup-groupprefs. I don't know if this 
  is a result of this plip or not but it is very confusing since they have the same icon 
  and title.
- In the Users Overview control panel, clicked 'add new user' and added another user to the 
  Site Adminstrators group. On reload, the user was added but their inherited role was not 
  displayed (it was not checked, and the plone symbol wasn't there either). So I investigated 
  and it looks like the groups are not getting assigned for reviewers or site admins. 
  Clicking on the user and adding to the group manually works as expected.
- Now this is a bikeshed argument but the version of this role that everyone sees is 
  "SiteAdmin" (no space), which is small but reminds me of when plone roles we equivalent to
  going to your own beheading. Any way we can put a space in here, or, restrict it to one 
  word so it feels refined? This is for sure small and I assume there is something 
  ridiculous to make this small change so I won't argue too hard for it.
- With the new site (the non upgraded is fine) there is an error trying to register as a 
  new user (enable self registration on) that could be from redoing forms: ComponentLookupError: ((<Products.CMFDefault.formlib.schema.FileUpload object at 0x10aec1210>, <HTTPRequest, URL=http://localhost:8080/roels/@@register>), <InterfaceClass zope.formlib.interfaces.IInputWidget>, u'')


Conclusion
----------
There are a few bugs but mostly superficial. I wouldn't release without the couple of 
fixes (especially the registration and migration) but I think its good to incorporate 
the changes for the rest of the plipping. In general everything looks nice and works 
as expected. The role will be a welcome addition.
