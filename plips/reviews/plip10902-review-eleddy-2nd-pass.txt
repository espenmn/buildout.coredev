PLIP 10902: New collections
===========================
PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10902

Review by Elizabeth Leddy (elizabeth.leddy@gmail.com, eleddy on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OSX using python 2.6.5 and Google Chrome

Review steps
------------
- New site, new collections and items. This is my second review so I'm 
  going to stick to the interaction this time.

Notes and observations
----------------------
- Update of search criteria is nice. Much better.
- Is there a migration strategy for current collections? I'm not sold that it 
  needs to be required but I can see why this may be a question for a lot of 
  people.

Must have changes
-----------------
- Description of content in preview should have class="description" and/or
  documentDescription so that it can be consistently formatted. Bonus if 
  the default theme is updated to grey this out.
- "X items matching your search terms" is a great idea. the wording is a bit
  weird for me - maybe "X items matching this search criteria" is a little 
  better? I'm open for argument on this - it was weird for me.
- WOW. You guys killed the creation date validation. Almost passed all of my tests.
  Almost :) Still failing on entering text, e.g. "June 23, 2011". This throws 
  an error in the backend. I would just make sure to catch those at minimum, 
  validate with javascript on the front end before sending the result for 
  bonus points and performance happiness.
  
Borderline
----------
- There is a TON of beautiful ajax in the search and then the edit portlet 
  interface is just bleh. I would roll love to see something smooth here. I know 
  that a lot of people don't currently use this necessarily now but they 
  could if it had a little wax and shine. 
- Review state selection is MUCHO better. The only think that is missing here 
  is file/image because they have no workflow. Ugh I know. I would just add an 
  option to that says "Include All Files and Images" or something like that.
- Would be nice to have javascript which hides "Number of Items" until/unless 
  Limit Search Results is checked. Would be extra nice to move this field on 
  top of the preview and include this in the limited results. Other option: in 
  the portlet, it just says specify max number or leave blank for none - why 
  not adopt this same approach in the product itself. If anything, it just makes 
  the interfaces the same. Also, its weird that the collection has a limit and 
  so does the portlet. Maybe a brief note on what overrides what?

Nice to have changes
--------------------
- There is something weird about listing the location after the result.
  This isn't obvious on a default install but behind rewriting I think it's
  quite awkward. I would either hide it, or better yet, allow the end user 
  to decide whether or not its displayed.
- IMHO, review state default should be "Published" so that things don't 
  disappear right away.
- Is there any way to only display "Table Columns" if the tabular view is 
  selected? 
- Should the default portlet include the item description? my intuition 
  says yes.
  

Conclusion
----------
I'm glad we waited on this update. Very nice. The 3 changes above should 
be easily fixable and I don't see why we can't merge. I actually might even 
use these things now :)

I would REALLY like to see portlet get a makover, but the rest of the 
changes are so good that I have no doubt that someone will be inspired to
join in and pretty up the interface. I know that if I get any cycles it's 
at the top of my list.
