PLIP 9938: factor custom output transformations out of the editors 
==================================================================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9938

Review by Alec Mitchell (alecpm@gmail.com, alecm on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.5 using python 2.6.6 and Google Chrome
8.0.552.215 beta


Review steps
------------

- Ran the plip9938-output-filters.cfg buildout.

- Ran tests for all customized packages and compared output to
  standard buildout test results.

- Installed new Plone site and tested functionality through the Plone
  interface in both kupu and TinyMCE.

- Examined code changes.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- Tests for plone.outputfilters, plone.uuid and plone.app.uuid all pass.

- There is a single test failure in a new test in Products.kupu.  It
  appears the test expects the alt text to be used as the caption, but
  the image description is being used as the caption.  This may be a
  test error.

- There are 2 errors and 1 failure in Products.CMFPlone tests which do
  not occur on trunk.  However, it appears that these are issues
  unrelated to the PLIP implementation and were fixed on trunk after
  branching.

- All other tests pass.

- In TinyMCE, the uid transform and image captions work as expected.

- In kupu, the uid transform and image captions work as expected.

- The code in plone.outputfilters implements a nice framework for
  defining and registering ordered HTML output filters which will
  automatically be applied when transforming output to
  text/x-html-safe.

- The plone.outputfilters code appears reasonable and seems to be well
  tested (over 80% coverage on every module, with 100% on many).

- The Products.CMFPlone.CatalogTool module imports IUUID and IUUIDAware,
  but does not use them.

- Care seems to have been taken to preserve backwards compatibility in
  kupu and TinyMCE, facilitate migration from older versions, and
  support plone < 4.1.

- The changes in other packages appear to be well thought out and
  include appropriate tests where necessary.

Conclusion
----------

Both the new filter framework and the refactoring of existing UID
filters are well implemented.  This is certainly a worthwhile
improvement and should be accepted for merge pending a determination
of the cause of the failing test in Products.kupu.
