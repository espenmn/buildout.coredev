PLIP 11880: Ship with plone.app.theming
=======================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11880

Review #2 by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.8 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 5.0.1.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip11880-plone-app-theming.cfg file.

- Run tests for diazo, plone.app.theming, plone.resource, plone.subrequest,
  plone.transformchain, repoze.xmliter

- Visual review of the code in the above mentioned packages

- Start instance, create a site, install p.a.theming

- Create simple zip based and simple file based themes


Notes and observations
----------------------
- All tests of all the packages pass. Overall coverage is good (>= 80/90%),
  with the exception of some modules in the p.a.theming package.

- Code in the above mentioned packages looks sane.

- When starting the instance a /plips/resources folder is expected which isn't
  there, should this point to /resources ?

- After creating a site and installing p.a.theming some views are styled which
  don't need to be styled (like the zmi or some popups). XDV used exclude
  paths to prevent the styling, p.a.theming uses css selectors to check the
  content. You can also set the X-Theme-Disabled http header. This might be
  usefull to add by default to certain views. Especially when you look for
  example at p.a.cmsui which will need this functionality also.

- The control panel contains 2 "Theme settings" panels. One for "old style"
  theming and one for Diazo theming. They have to be either merged or the
  naming should be changed so integrators know which one is for what.

- Creating and installing themes based on zip files and file system is easy
  and works really well.


Conclusion
----------

Great product and a huge improvement for theming especially for people new to
Plone. You can theme a Plone site without knowing the internals. Good
coverage, good code, good documentation, this is ready for merge.
