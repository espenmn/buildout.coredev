PLIP 9352: Improved search results view
=======================================

This plip is ready for review.

Plip ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9352


Known Issues
------------

There is a TODO.txt file in docs/ folder of plone.app.search package that
contains things left to be fixed and to be implemented. Other than that, the
major issue with the current implementation is that the new search results page
is slower than the old one. To get exact numbers to compare run performance
tests with:

  bin/test -s plone.app.search --tests-pattern=performance

By simple "remove from template" method was figured out that the fact of
merging advanced search form into the search results page is not a reason for
slower view. This might be related to the way methods from
plone.app.contentlisting work, since the new search is wrapping results into
IContentListing interface. Would appreciate if somebody could help in figuring
out the actual reason.


Summary
-------

Improved search results view is a combination of regular results view and
advanced search form where we can use fields of the form as the additional
filters of our search results. Advantage of the new view is in it's dynamic
presentation of the results by serving updated results with ajax calls after
applying filters or changing the sorting.

In addition locations of some elements have been re-thought in order to let
users get to the search results faster without minimum disturbance.

Sorting options have been renamed to better match "normal humans" language.

The new search results view also provides information about section a search item is located in. This functionality is using elementary caching so doesn't slow down the search results view unless there are a lot of different sections in the site's root and the search results are coming from different sections.

New search results view is also very accessible, so if javascript is disabled in a browser the user will get all the information equivalent to those with JS enabled but without ajax calls. That means when-ever a user is changing a filter or a sorting option he needs to re-submit the form.


Dependencies
------------

Dependancies are available in the corresponding trunks or branches and are checked out from the PLIP's configuration:

- Products.CMFPlone

- plone.app.contentlisting

- plone.app.upgrade

- plonetheme.sunburst

- plonetheme.classic

- plone.app.layout

- plone.testing/plone.app.testing


Tests and code checkers
-----------------------

- Selenium tests for ajax integration and some default elements testing. Moved
  out of the general testing flow to not slow down the testing of Plone.

- Performance tests (failing at the moment) to compare how much the new search
  is slower than the old one. Moved out of the general testing flow to not slow
  down the testing of Plone.

- jslint, pyflakes, PEP8 check ups
