PLIP #12235 implementation notes (Unify batching)
=================================================

Implementer: Tom Gross
PLIP text: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/12235

Reference buildout is at git://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev.git; run with
-c plips/plip12234-batching.cfg. 

I introduced a new package plone.batching. This package is supposed to do
*all* batching in Plone. It has 100% test coverage.

I pointed all known batching implementations to plone.batching and removed
all custom batching code. The known batches are in

 - Products.CMFPlone.PloneBatch (e.g. search)
 - plone.app.content (e.g. folder_contents)
 - plone.z3cform (e.g. ??? -> singing and dancing).

To generate the sphinx api documentation run bin/sphinx.

The implementation aims to be 100% backwards compatible, there is one
decision I made. In the former PloneBatch *len* returned the length of a
batch and in the former plone.app.content *len* returned the full length
of the sequence passed to the batch. In plone.batching the behavior is the
later. The len-method returns the full length of the sequence which is used
for the batch. The former PloneBatch behavior still works if imported from
Products.CMFPlone.PloneBatch. A deprecation warning is emited to use the
*pagesize* attribute for getting the batch length.

Test cases are:

 - Add a lot items to a folder and call `folder_contents`
 - Add a lot items to the site with one term present and search for it
 - Install c.dancing and add a lot subscribers to a newsletter

I plan to add developer documentation of how to use batches in custom code
and templates.
