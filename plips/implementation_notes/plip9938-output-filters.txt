PLIP #9938 implementation notes
===============================

(factor custom output transformations out of the editors)

Implementer: David Glick
PLIP text: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9938

Reference buildout is at
https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/buildouts/plone-coredev/branches/4.1; run with
-c plips/plip9938-output-filters.cfg. This buildout is also used for PLIP 10778
for ease of testing, but PLIP 9938 is not dependent on 10778.  The main packages
with changes relevant to PLIP 9938 are:

* plone.outputfilters (new package)
* Products.kupu
* Products.TinyMCE
* (Plone and plone.app.upgrade have some trivial changes.)

``plone.outputfilters`` contains an implementation of the "resolve UID links"
and "add image captions" features, based on both the old kupu implementation
and the old TinyMCE implementation.  The editors have been updated to depend
on and install plone.outputfilters, and their tests for these features have
been ported to plone.outputfilters.

The old transforms in the editor packages have been turned into stubs which
defer to the plone.outputfilters implementation. (They cannot be removed
entirely at this point, because of persistent references in the database.) There
is an upgrade step which replaces the old transforms with the new one when Plone
is upgraded to 4.1. plone.outputfilters can also be installed in older versions
of Plone.

Each editor used to have its own resolveuid.py script in a skin layer; this has
been turned into one browser view in plone.outputfilters. This view is aware of
plone.app.uuid (from PLIP 10778) and will use it to resolve UIDs if present.
Otherwise (such as in Plone < 4.1) there is a fallback to the old approach
(querying the catalog directly).  The editors' content browsers have also been
updated to use the plone.app.uuid API when available.

See the plone.outputfilters README for more details.

While implementing the new transform, I took the opportunity to resolve a
few outstanding bugs:

* Rendering relative links (i.e. with link-by-UID off) out-of-context (such as
  in the new "All content" listing view) could result in broken links or links
  that only worked thanks to Acquisition. Relative links are now absolutized to
  avoid this problem.
* The TinyMCE image dialog failed to highlight the current
  image if it was created when link-by-UID was off but it is now on, or vice
  versa. (See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10970). This is now fixed.
* TinyMCE allowed the user to edit an image's alt text, and used it as the
  caption in preference to the image's description. This caused confusion
  for users migrating from kupu who had carefully set up distinct descriptions
  and alt text. It was also a misuse of the alt text concept (which is intended
  as a fallback when an image can't be rendered, not an always-present caption).
  I've changed TinyMCE to edit the image's description instead, and always
  use the description as the caption (like kupu did).
