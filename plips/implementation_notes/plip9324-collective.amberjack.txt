=====================================================

Implementer: see http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.amberjack.core/tags/1.1/docs/AUTHORS.txt
PLIP text: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9324

Reference buildout is at
https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/buildouts/plone-coredev/branches/4.1; 
run with
-c plips/plip9324-collective.amberjack.cfg. 

What to review
--------------
Create a new Plone site. Add 'Amberjack' and 'Amberjack tour launcher' products.
It installs:
 - the AJ core
 - the launch portlet on the left column
 - 12 tours
Now you can choose to run the tours in two different ways:
 - standalone. It runs the tours in the root folder of your Plone site.
 - in a sandbox. It runs the tours in the actual user's folder.
By default the 'standalone' option is enabled. You can use the 'admin' user to
run all the tours.
If you want to enable the 'sandbox' one you need to:
 - set the users folders
 - add a new user
 - in his members folder, he needs to have these roles set:
   - contributor
   - editor
   - reviewer
 - log in with that user and run the tours

Use the portlet to start the tours. The portlet also tells you what you need to
do to start a given tour. For example:
 - if you misconfigure the sandbox option, it won't let you start any tour.
 - if a tour needs a 'review' role and you don't give it to your user that tour
   will be unavailable (shown, but without the link to let it start)
 - to run the 'create a page' one, you need to have the 'MyFolder' already
   created.

The tours are made of several steps. Every step is divided into several 
micro-step. During the tours you can both use the '>>' marker you'll find on 
the right side of every microstep or do it directly inside the plone interface.
In some cases you won't find a '>>' marker, but just a description of what you
have to do.

Some micro-step are mandatory, others not. We decided to not put any evidence on
the interface (eg. the usual plone tiny red square). Every micro-step is an
order ('enter this value in that field', 'write something in another one') so
it's already clear what you should do. 

The validations are needed just to make the output of every tour consistent 
with all the other tours. For example, you need to call the initial folder 
'MyFolder' because of the plone-ids and because is referred in all the other
tours. We planned to remove this limitation in a further release.

If you miss a mandatory micro-step a popup will alert you that you need to 
complete it before continuing. Before leaving the page, for example submitting
a form, it will check if you did every thing that was needed.

Of course you are free to exit the tour in any moment clicking on the big X
in the left top corner of the tour box.

Preconditions and validations
-----------------------------
There are preconditions and validations that can be set and have to be met.

Preconditions are related to tours. 
As stated before, you can add a page only if a folder that should contain the 
page had already been created ('isCreated') and if that page hadn't already been
created ('isNotCreated'). In addition, you have to be a Contributor ('hasRole') 
to add it and Reviewer ('hasRole' again) to publish it.
In the same way all the other tours has been configured

Validation are related to micro-steps. 
You have to name the page 'My Page' o/w it will break the further tours. You 
need to complete all the plone mandatory fields. A given field must be not 
empty.
So those conditions may be:
 - checkstep: checks that the user actually did what the step asked for
 - a dictionary: 
        {"selector":{"description":"id"},"operator":"co","value":"Plone"}
 - doitmanually: if set, this means that the user has to complete the microstep
   manually.
 - or none

The start portlet
-----------------
It is configurable. you can choose:
 - the title
 - the tours that you want to show
 - their order
 - the layout

The tours
---------
The tours are all .cfg files in the collective.amberjack.plonetour package.
They are stored inside the "tours" folder with their translations.
Through the configuration in buildout they are available for the user.

The available right now are:
 - Add and publish a folder
 - Add and publish a Page
 - Add and publish a News Item
 - Add and publish an Event
 - Format a page using the visual editor
 - Create internal links
 - Create external links
 - Upload an image
