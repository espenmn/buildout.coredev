PLIP #9327 implementation notes (plone.app.contentlisting)
=====================================================
implementer: Geir BÃ¦kholt and friends

Plip ticket: 
http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9327

Reference buildout is at
https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/buildouts/plone-coredev/branches/4.1; 
run with
-c plips/plip9327-contentlisting.cfg. 

What to review: 

The main usecase for contentlisting is to make lists of content items
in Plone uniform, regardless what the source of the content items is:
the catalog, a folderlisting, an orm or something completely
different.

On its own, the most useful way of reviewing it is to look at the
tests and the code.

There is a very basic doctest that introduces the concept of the
contentlisting from pure python, and an integration test suite that
covers more of the real life usage.


There are plans to change several or all of the templates listing
content in Plone to use plone.app.contentlisting, but have not yet had
time.  For this purpose Plone itself has been branched and added to
this plip config file. No files have yet been modified in that
branched Plone.



Contentlisting is used as a base for the implementation of
#9352-search-results and plip10902-new-collections


TO DO
======

* convert existing templates in Plone and default portlets to use contentlistings

* Write better documentation for non-developers / template-tinkerers. 

* improve test-coverage to 100% (we are close, but not all there yet)

* some more coverage of Dubmin Core methods

* Check if this works for Dexterity types or if they need special handling.
