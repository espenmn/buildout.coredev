PLIP #10901 implementation notes
================================

(Set and enforce base coding standards for our own JavaScript)

Implementer: Steve McMahon
PLIP text: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10901

The "enforce" portion of this PLIP is not completed.

Standards
=========

A new section of the developer manual has been written to document coding and
deployment practices. It's available, in draft mode, at:

http://plone.org/documentation/manual/developer-manual/client-side-functionality-javascript

Readers may need to be logged in to read this.

Like the rest of the developer manual, this is intended to be a work in 
progress.

Code Review and Update
======================

Branch of Products.CMFPlone at:

https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/Plone/branches/plip10901-jslintification

A js-standards.js file in plone_ecmascripts sets jslint flags that are intended
to set baseline standards.

All of the JavaScripts in plone_ecmascripts have been reviewed and revised to 
pass jslint checks with those options (and occasional per-module switches to
avoid coding I thought unnecessary).

The coverage of test_rendering.pt (in plone_templates) has been extended to 
cover more of the code in plone_ecmascripts, and should be near complete.
